# odin-landing-page

In this project, I will be creating a landing page based on a provided design. I will be getting two images as part of this design: one will be an image of the complete website, and one will have details about some of the fonts and colors that were used for the website.

This project will display the HTML and CSS skills that I have learned until this point, particularly on CSS fundamentals and alignment.
